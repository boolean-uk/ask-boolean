## Welcome to Ask Boolean!

Getting stuck is important! If there's anything that unites every single Booleaner it's that you all have got stuck and unstuck :) Getting stuck is a fantastic opportunity to learn!
It's quick feedback that you’re learning, and you’re about to learn something! Teachers won’t be here always, so the intention of this process is to help you stand on your own two feet as soon as you can. In this way you can solve any problem with time!

Even better that that, getting unstuck/learning is a skill we can improve! [Growth mindset](http://www.queenannefirstschool.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/A-Guide-to-the-Fixed-Mindset-V-the-Growth-Mindset-MF-Oc.pdf)! 

So. What do you do when you get stuck? Below you'll find a guide. Each step of this guide is outcome-driven. To get the best from this guide, aim to get the outcome for each step you go through.

Additionally, if you get stuck on one of these steps (while stuck on the original problem..) there's a starter question you can pose to a teacher. Remember - getting unstuck is a skill we can improve!

# Getting Unstuck

1. [Diagnose: What are you stuck on?](#1-diagnose-what-are-you-stuck-on)
2. [Identify available resources](#2-identify-available-resources)
3. [Create a query](#3-create-a-query)
4. [Query the available resources one at a time to get information.](#4-query-the-available-resources-one-at-a-time-to-get-information)
5. [Understand and apply the information.](#5-understand-and-apply-the-information)
6. [Review the process](#6-review-the-process)

## 1. Diagnose: What are you stuck on?
This step is critical, but it’s not always easy. Often you might find you resolve your question with this step because it forces you out of the tunnel of your current problem, to step back and evaluate.

**Outcome**: a list of hints, something specific to get information about.

**Process**: Clarify what it is you’re stuck on (diagnose means get visibility!)

0. [Rubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)[duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)!
1. Write it down. 
  - The error message, the line number, the file
  - A type of transformation of input to output
  - The concept or skill you're grappling with.
2. If this is tough or too vague
  1. Reduce scope: identify part of the problem and go through this process again.

**To improve:** A good question to ask a teacher: “I’m stuck. These are the things I’ve noted - what am I missing?” 

**Examples**
Bad: I'm stuck on JavaScript classes
Good: I don't understand the difference between a class and an instance of a class or how the constructor function works.

Bad: I have an error when I run my code
Good: The output in my terminal shows me I have a Syntax Error on line 23, from file 'src/basket.js'.

## 2. Identify available resources and tools.
This is usually a quick step - only changes in a new environment. So pay particular attention when you start a new language/framework/part of the stack
**outcome**: a priority list of available resources

**Process**
0. Identify tools to get visibility
  - functions then send data to a console/terminal output eg: `console.log()` for JS
  - step-by-step debuggers
  - debugging applications
  - log sources (server logs, production logs, local logs)
1. Identify internal/external 
  - documentation
  - videos
  - blogs
  - articles
  - Peers
  - experts
2. Order the resources by cost to access and relevancy: usually (installed tools and well-organised internal docs ——> new tools, experts)
        
**To improve:** A good question to ask a teacher: “I’m stuck on xyz. I've identified these information sources as resources. Am I missing anything?” "is abc a good resource?"

**Examples**
Bad: No identified!
Good: A good list of tools and resources!

## 3. Create a query
Questions are your main tool to get information. Questions are fantastic, amazing, and you should spend a lot of time asking questions and thinking about getting better at creating questions!

**Outcome**: a question you can ask a teacher, a search term to look up in documentation, a query you can google

**Process**
    1. Forming the query is tough!
    2. Create a good question
	
**To improve:** A good process-oriented question to ask a teacher: “I’m stuck. Abc are the things I’ve noted. I’ve searched for information about xyz with “a search query”. What query would you have searched for?

**Examples**
Bad: 
Good:

## 4. Query the available resources one at a time to get information.
**Process**
    1. internal/external documentation (20mins)
        - , videos, blogs, articles
    2. Peers (10mins)
    3. experts (raise a support ticket)
    
**To improve:** A good process-oriented question to ask a teacher: “I’ve been stuck on xyz. I've looked at doc abc for ghi mins. Should I escalate now or continue trying to understand the doc?

**Examples**
Bad:  straight to experts, spending 100mins on (1) 
Good: move from one to another
 
## 5. Understand and apply the information.
**Process**
    1. explain what you've learned to yourself or a community member
    2. create small examples demonstrating applying the knowledge
    2. evaluate the information you have
    3. apply it your work
    
**To improve:** Ask a teacher "I'm trying to understand about xyz from source abc. How can I get better at applying this information?

**Examples**
Bad:  
Good: 

## 6. Review the process
**Outcome:** Actionable feedback
**Process**
    1. Identify if there were any missed stages
    2. Identify stages that took the most time.
    
**To improve:** A good process-oriented question to ask a teacher: “how do you review a process?"

**Examples**
Bad:  no review
Good: I spent too long on the diagnosis phase, I need to improve this by asking a teacher for feedback on how I can improve on what I did.
