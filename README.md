## Welcome to Ask Boolean!

Getting stuck is important! If there's anything that unites every single Booleaner it's that you all have got stuck and unstuck :) Getting stuck is a fantastic opportunity to learn!
It's quick feedback that you’re learning, and you’re about to learn something! Teachers won’t be here always, so the intention of this process is to help you stand on your own two feet as soon as you can. In this way you can solve any problem with time!

Even better that that, getting unstuck/learning is a skill we can improve! [Growth mindset](http://www.queenannefirstschool.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/A-Guide-to-the-Fixed-Mindset-V-the-Growth-Mindset-MF-Oc.pdf)! 

So. What do you do when you get stuck? Below you'll find a guide. Each step of this guide is outcome-driven. To get the best from this guide, aim to get the outcome for each step you go through.

Additionally, if you get stuck on one of these steps (while stuck on the original problem..) there's a starter question you can pose to a teacher. Remember - getting unstuck is a skill we can improve!

# Getting Unstuck

1. [Diagnose: What are you stuck on?](#1-diagnose-what-are-you-stuck-on)
2. [Identify available resources](#2-identify-available-resources-and-tools)
3. [Create a query](#3-create-a-query)
4. [Query the available resources one at a time to get information.](#4-query-the-available-resources-one-at-a-time-to-get-information)
5. [Understand and apply the information.](#5-understand-and-apply-the-information)
6. [Review the process](#6-review-the-process)

# 1. Diagnose: What are you stuck on?
This step is critical, but it’s not always easy. Often you might find you resolve your question with this step because it forces you out of the tunnel of your current problem, to step back and evaluate.

### Outcome
A list of hints, something specific to get information about.

### Process
Clarify what it is you’re stuck on (diagnose means get visibility!)

0. [Rubber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)[duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com/)!
1. **Write it down!**
  - The error message, the line number, the file
  - A type of transformation of input to output
  - The concept or skill you're grappling with.
2. **If this is tough or too vague**
  1. Reduce scope: identify part of the problem and go through this process again.

### To improve
A good question to ask a teacher: “I’m stuck. These are the things I’ve noted - what am I missing?” 

### Examples
```
Bad: I'm stuck on JavaScript classes
Good: I don't understand the difference between a class and an instance of a class
Good: I don't understand how using the `new` keyword relates to the constructor function and its arguments.
```
```
Bad: I have an error when I run my code
Good: The output in my terminal shows me I have a Syntax Error on line 23, from file 'src/basket.js'.
```

# 2. Identify available resources and tools
This is usually a quick step - only changes in a new environment. So pay particular attention when you start a new language/framework/part of the stack

### outcome
A priority list of available resources

### Process
0. **Identify tools to get visibility**
  - functions then send data to a console/terminal output eg: `console.log()` for JS
  - step-by-step debuggers
  - debugging applications
  - log sources (server logs, production logs, local logs)
1. **Identify internal/external**
  - documentation
  - videos
  - blogs
  - articles
  - Peers
  - experts
2. **Order the resources by cost to access and relevancy**
  -  usually (installed tools and well-organised internal docs ——> new tools, experts)
        
### To improve
A good question to ask a teacher: “I’m stuck on xyz. I've identified these information sources as resources. Am I missing anything?” "is abc a good resource?"

### Examples
```
Bad: None identified!
Good: A good list of tools and resources!
```
# 3. Create a query
Questions are your main tool to get information. Questions are fantastic, amazing, and you should spend a lot of time asking questions and thinking about getting better at creating questions! This is another skill we can improve!

### Outcome
A question you can ask a teacher, a useful print statement to add to your code, a search term to look up in documentation, a query you can google

### Process for research
1. Identify key words.
2. Identify broader context (eg language, skill, concept)
3. Put them together

### Process for visibility
1. Identify the last place in your program that worked as expected
2. Identify what information you need to reason better about your program
3. add at least 1 print statement appropriately (eg above the erroring line), interrogating a variable, operation, return value, function call.
	
### To improve
A good process-oriented question to ask a teacher: 
- “I’m stuck. Abc are the things I’ve noted. I’ve searched for information about xyz with “a search query”. What query would you have searched for?
- I've added print statements to get visibility at these points in my program, where else could I get better visibility?

### Examples
```
Bad: classes
Good: create instance of a class using new keyword in JS
```
```
Bad: classes 
Good: how does encapsulation in JS work using classes
```
```
Bad: npm not working
Good: [copy error message from terminal output from running npm command]
```
```
Bad: No print statements added to code
Good: A series of print statements with descriptions that interrogate your program at intentional points to give you useful visibility.
```

# 4. Query the available resources one at a time to get information.

**Process**
1. **Internal/external documentation** (20mins)
 - documentation, videos, blogs, articles
 - if it's searchable, jump to your chosen keywords and read above and below.
 - If the video has timestamps, jump to the relevant section. Watch at 2x speed until content becomes relevant
 - Focus ruthlessly on your keywords - not much else is important right now
 - Write down information that seems relevant. It's possible to use this new information and repeat from Step 3 to narrow in on what you need.
 - Do not spend longer than 20 mins in this phase - escalate to the next step.
2. **Peers** (10mins)
 - Ask your peers - find out if your peers have encountered the problem, have any insight.
4. **Experts**
 - Ask your teachers! Being asked questions is one of their responsibilities!
    
### To improve
A good process-oriented question to ask a teacher: “I’ve been stuck on xyz. I've looked at doc abc for ghi mins. Should I escalate now or continue trying to understand the doc?

### Examples
```
Bad: straight to experts, spending 100mins on (1)
Good: move from one to another
```

# 5. Understand and apply the information.
This is the goal! All the work you've done so far is to get to this stage. Nice job so far. Take the smallest new thing you've read about it. Don't try to understand and apply everything at once: take small steps.

### Process

1. **Explain** what you've learned to yourself or a community member
2. **Create** very small, simple examples demonstrating applying the knowledge
3. **Evaluate** the new information you have learnt (is it enough?
4. **Apply** it to your work 
and/or
5. **Create** new learning objectives if needed/wanted
    
### To improve
Ask a teacher "I'm trying to understand about xyz from source abc. How can I get better at applying this information?

### Examples
```
Bad: Doing lots of reading about a topic and **not** processing the information by explaining or creating.
Good: Writing notes or summaries of understanding, using a REPL or playing around with code to test out new JS knowledge and concepts.
```

# 6. Review the process
Spend a short time reflecting on how you moved through the different stages - which feel easy, which feel hard. What can you do to improve?

### Outcome
Specific, actionable feedback

### Process
1. Reflect on how you feel going through these steps
2. Identify if there were any missed stages
3. Identify stages that took the least time.
4. Identify stages that took the most time.
    
### To improve:** A good process-oriented question to ask a teacher: “how do you review a process?"

### Examples
```
Bad: no review
Good: I spent too long on the diagnosis phase, I need to improve this by asking a teacher for feedback on how I can improve on what I did.
```
